# Prodigy_DS_2
I have accomplished my second task as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech, where I worked on the suggested datasetâ€”the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The primary focus of my task involved comprehensive data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). For visualization purposes, I utilized the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. Initially, I conducted a detailed data description using dataset info tools, followed by systematic data cleaning procedures to address missing values. Subsequently, during the EDA phase, I examined numerical variables, followed by a thorough exploration of categorical variables. I presented the findings through visually appealing plots. I express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with this valuable learning opportunity.
